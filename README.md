# Simulating-OT-Nodes-with-micro-ROS-and-DDS
This project simulates an **Operational Technology (OT) network** using **Renode**, an emulator for microcontrollers like **RISC-V** and **ARM**. Each device runs **micro-ROS**, a lightweight version of **ROS 2**, enabling real-time messaging. **DDS (Data Distribution Service)** provides communication via **publish/subscribe** messaging.
